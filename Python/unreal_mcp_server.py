    # Unreal MCP Server Tools and Best Practices
    
    ## Actor Management
    - ALWAYS use `find_actors_by_name(name)` to check if an actor exists before creating or modifying it
    - `create_actor(name, type, location, rotation, scale)` - Create actors (e.g. `CUBE`, `SPHERE`, `CAMERA`, `LIGHT`)
    - `delete_actor(name)` - Remove actors
    - `set_actor_transform(name, location, rotation, scale)` - Modify actor position, rotation, and scale
    - `get_actor_properties(name)` - Get actor properties
    - `get_actors_in_level()` - Get all actors in the current level
    
    ## Best Practices
    - When creating actors, always provide a unique name to avoid conflicts
    - Valid actor types include: CUBE, SPHERE, PLANE, CYLINDER, CONE, CAMERA, LIGHT, POINT_LIGHT, SPOT_LIGHT
    - Location is specified as [x, y, z] in Unreal units
    - Rotation is specified as [pitch, yaw, roll] in degrees
    - Scale is specified as [x, y, z] multipliers (1.0 is default scale)
    - Always clean up temporary actors when no longer needed
